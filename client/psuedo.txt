if color goes to green then set the border color to that permanently


now when clicking button: button goes blue. click on different button, that button goes blue and first clicked button goes to default. if buttoncombo is true, ie if the top note and
the bottom number are the same then both buttons get green border. problem is when clicking another button the green buttons are still comparing.

how to fix: if buttons are green do not change color. If isComboCorrect === true


if button.style.borderColor === green do not change the color. like if it has been set to correct then it cannot be changed
